#### [A - Grid 1](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/A)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the number of ways to reach a specific cell in a grid, we can leverage a dynamic programming approach. Starting from the initial cell (0,0), we can calculate the number of paths to each subsequent cell by considering the number of paths to the cells above and to the left.
>
> Since we can only move downward or rightward, we can process the cells in a specific order, ensuring that we've already calculated the number of paths to the cells that precede them. This sequential processing can be efficiently implemented using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
>
> During the BFS, for each cell we visit, we calculate the sum of the number of paths to the cell above and the cell to the left. This sum represents the total number of ways to reach the current cell. By iteratively applying this calculation to each cell in the grid, we can accurately determine the number of paths to the desired destination cell.

	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
>   To identify the number of distinct rooms within the image, we can employ a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We'll systematically traverse each cell of the image. For each unvisited cell representing a walkable path (denoted by a dot), we initiate a BFS to explore all connected walkable cells, effectively delineating a room. By counting the number of BFS executions, we can accurately determine the total number of rooms.

#### [C - Japanese Cursed Doll ](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/C)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the minimum number of days required for at least P people to have hair length greater than or equal to T, we can sort the initial hair lengths in descending order. This allows us to efficiently identify the P-th person with the longest hair length.
>
> The number of days we need to wait is the difference between the target hair length T and the hair length of the P-th person. However, if the P-th person's hair length is already greater than or equal to T, we don't need to wait at all. We can ensure this by taking the maximum between 0 and the calculated difference. If the difference is non-positive, it indicates that we don't need to wait.

#### [D - Bits Equalizer Kattis](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/D)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> Since we can only convert zeros to ones (not the other way around), we'll first focus on eliminating discrepancies in the ones. 
>
> The optimal approach is to swap a misplaced one with a misplaced zero, as this simultaneously corrects two positions in a single move.
>
> After addressing the ones, if any incorrect ones remain, we'll need to swap them with question marks that should be zeros, as there's no other way to rectify them and this will also fix the zeros in the same move.
>
> Once these steps are completed, we can calculate the minimum number of moves:
>
> * One move per mark: Each mark will be converted to its correct value.
> * One move per remaining incorrect zero: Each zero will be transformed into a one.
>
> If any incorrect ones persist after these operations, it's impossible to reach the target configuration.

<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To solve this problem, we can process each line as a string. We'll iterate through the characters of the string, checking for the presence of '+' or '-' symbols. When we encounter one of these symbols, we'll perform the corresponding operation on the answer variable. At the end, just print the result.

#### [F - Subordinates](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/F)

<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the number of descendants for each node in a tree-like structure, we can employ a recursive approach. Starting from a specific node, we recursively count its direct and indirect descendants. This involves traversing the tree, summing the number of descendants for each child node, and adding 1 to account for the node itself. By systematically applying this recursive process to each node, we can accurately calculate the number of descendants for every member of the tree.

#### [G - Soldier and Bananas](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/G)

<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the additional bananas needed, we can calculate the total number of bananas requested over the i days. The request pattern follows an arithmetic progression: k, 2k, 3k, ..., ik.
>
> The sum of this arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula: k * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + i). The sum of the first i natural numbers is given by the formula: i * (i + 1) / 2.
>
> Therefore, the total number of bananas requested is: k * (i * (i + 1) / 2).
>
> To find the additional bananas needed, we subtract the initial number of bananas (n) from the total requested. However, if the result is negative, it means we have enough bananas initially, and no additional bananas are required. So, we take the maximum of 0 and the calculated difference to ensure we get a non-negative value.

#### [H - Digits](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/H)

<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the number of iterations required to reach a specific state in the given sequence, we can employ a straightforward iterative approach. Starting with an initial value, we repeatedly apply a function that calculates the number of digits in the current value. This process continues until the current value matches the number of digits in the previous value. By counting the number of iterations, we can accurately determine the desired result.

#### [I - Books](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/I)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To determine the maximum achievable size, we can reframe the problem as finding the farthest reachable index for each element in the array, given a specific sum constraint.
>
> Binary Search Approach:
> We can efficiently solve this problem by sorting the array and then using binary search to locate the farthest reachable index for each element. The maximum difference between the current index and the farthest reachable index represents the maximum achievable size.
>
> Two-Pointer Approach:
> An alternative approach involves using two pointers to iterate through the sorted array. The left pointer keeps track of the current element, while the right pointer expands to include more elements until the sum constraint is violated. The maximum difference between the pointers represents the maximum achievable size.

#### [J - Firefly](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/J)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
> To answer this question, we need a method to count the number of stalactites and stalagmites at each level. To efficiently do this, we can separate each type into individual arrays and sort them.
>
> For the bottom array, the number of collisions for a given index i is the number of stalagmites with a height less than or equal to this height. This can be determined by subtracting the total number of stalagmites (n/2) from the number of stalagmites with a height greater than this hight.
>
> Similarly, for the top array, the number of collisions for a stalactite at index i is the number of stalactites with a height greater than or equal to the desired height. We can invert this height, using the formula (h - i + 1). Thus, we can calculate this using the same approach as before.
>
> To efficiently compute these collision counts, we can employ techniques like Binary Search or Two Pointers.
>
> Finally, we can determine the level with the minimum number of collisions by using a frequency map to count the occurrences of each collision count.

<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
>   To calculate the total distance traveled, we iterate through the checkpoints, determining the distance between consecutive checkpoints. Each distance is then multiplied by a factor that increases incrementally with each subsequent checkpoint. By summing these weighted distances, we arrive at the final total duration of the video.

#### [L - Buildings](https://vjudge.net/contest/673106#problem/L)
<details>
	<summary><b>&nbsp ðŸ“‚ Solution</b></summary>
	
>   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each input building's height. For each building, we compare its height to the height of the first building. If a building is taller than the first one, we've found our answer, and we can immediately print its index (starting from 1) and halt the input process.
>
> If we reach the end of the input without finding a taller building, we can conclude that no such building exists and print -1.
